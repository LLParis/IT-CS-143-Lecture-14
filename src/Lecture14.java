        // Self-Check Problems:
        // Section 15.3: Advanced Features
        // 14. When this new version of the class fills to its capacity, it resizes.
        // How much does it grow? Why choose this growth rate, rather than increasing
        // the capacity by a single element or other constant amount?
        // When this new version of a class resizes, it grows by a factor of 1.5 or 50%.
        // This is more efficient because it amortizes the performance expensive by batching
        // the add operations into one instead if calling add repeatedly which would be O(n).

        // 15. What is the benefit of adding an iterator to the list class?
        // an iterator allows you to traverse through the collection. It allows you to do so
        // without needing to know the internal structure and works with any collection.

        // 16. What state does the array list iterator store?
        // Current position, reference to the collection it is iterating over,

        // 17. How does the array list iterator know if there are more elements left to
        // examine?
        // What does it do if the client tries to examine a next element but there are
        // none left to examine?
        // An array list iterator knows if there are more elements left to examine by using
        // the .hasNext() method in a while-loop that checks for the next element.
        // if there are no more elements left to examine, the loop will throw a
        // NoSuchElementException

        // 18. What is a precondition of the iterator’s remove method?
        // How does the iterator enforce this precondition, and what does it do if the
        // precondition is violated?
        // The precondition is, remove() can only be called once per next() and cannot be
        // called before a next() is called. This is to ensure there is an element there.
        // It enforces this precondition by keeping track of the iterator. If it is violated, it throws an
        // IllegalStateException

        // 19. Write a method called sum that returns the sum of all values in the list.
        // For example, if a variable called list stores [11, –7, 3, 42, 0, 14], the
        // call of list.sum() should return 63. If the list is empty, sum should return
        // 0.
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(11, -7, 3, 42, 0, 14));
        ArrayIntList list2 = new ArrayIntList(list);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + list2.sum());

        // 20. Write a method called average that returns the average of the values in
        // the list as a real number.
        // For example, if a variable called list stores [11, –7, 3, 42, 0, 14], the
        // call of list.average() should return 10.5. If the list is empty, average
        // should return 0.0.
        System.out.println("Average: " + list2.average());

        // Section 15.4: ArrayList<E>
        // 21. What problem do we encounter when we try to construct an array of type E?
        // How do we resolve this problem?
        // If I try to construct an array of type E, type erasure means that generic info is erased
        // at runtime and replaced with its bound or object. Since java needs to know arraus types at
        // runtime, we can use a @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") to suppress warnings from java.

        // 22. Since our list stores an unfilled array, the empty elements were filled
        // with the value 0 when our array was full of integers.
        // What value occupies the empty cells when our list stores values of type E?
        // The value of null occupies the empty cells when our list stores values of type E.

        // 23. What changes need to be made to the indexOf method to search for objects
        // of type E in the new list class, and why are these changes necessary?
        // Since E can be any object type, you must use the .equals() method to check for equality not ==
        // If E can be null, the indexOf method must include a null check

        // 24. What is an annotation? How are annotations useful in writing our
        // ArrayList<E> class?
        // Annotation is akin to comments, metadata, or subtitles that provide information about a program
        // without affecting the program itself.
        // They can provide documentation

        // 25. Why is it important to set empty elements to null when we are clearing or
        // removing from the list of type E, when we didn’t need to clear out these
        // elements in the previous ArrayIntList?
        // ArrayIntList deals with primitive data types where null is not applicable.
        // When you remove an element from a list, if the array does not nullify the removed element's
        // slot, the array still holds a reference to the removed object which is bad for performance.

        // 26. What is one benefit of making the list iterator into an inner class?
        // It allows you to eliminate the field that keeps track of the list. The instances of the inner class
        // have access to the methods and fields of the instance of the outer class.

        // Exercises:
        // None
